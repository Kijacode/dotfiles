Jest snippets for TypeScript done right.

Many people are not good in memorizing magic acronims like `desc`, `ae`, and similar.

So many books on coding stress on importance of readable names. So, it's okay to spell out snippets' prefixes:

## List of Snippets

| Prefix (name)                   | Snippet result                                  |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `jest-test-base`                | Jest test base (`describe()`).                  |
| `jest-test-with-array-of-cases` | `it()` test which works against multiple cases. |
